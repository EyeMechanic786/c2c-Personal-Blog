Starting my first coding project was intimidating, but I quickly realized how much I could automate in my daily work. Building simple tools has made my job easier and more enjoyable.

For clinicians, coding is more than just a technical skillâ€”it's a way to directly impact patient care and operational efficiency. By developing custom scripts or applications, clinicians can reduce manual errors, speed up documentation, and improve communication within healthcare teams.

Additionally, coding knowledge allows clinicians to better understand and influence the digital tools they use every day. This leads to more meaningful input during software development and ensures that technology solutions are aligned with real-world clinical workflows.
